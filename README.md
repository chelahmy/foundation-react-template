# Foundation-React Template
A starter for front-end project using both [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com) and [React](https://reactjs.org) frameworks.

Clone this repository into a folder
```
$ git clone https://github.com/chelahmy/foundation-react-template.git my-project
$ cd my-project
```
and run the following command to download dependencies.
```
$ npm i

The tool-chain will build the project into the `dist` folder and run it in a browser. Any changes made in the `src` folder will trigger the tool-chain to rebuild the project and push the changes to the browser in real time.

Begin with the `src/index.html` and `src/js/app.js` files. The resulting `dist` folder is standalone and can be deployed to a web server.

Please refer to the Foundation and React websites for detail documentation regarding the individual frameworks.
